# Object Detection - SSD-MobileNet

![](output_screenshot_30.03ddd.2023.png)


* Learn about *MobileNets* and separable depthwise convolutions.
* The SSD (Single Shot Detection) architecture used for object detection
* Use pretrained TensorFlow object detection inference models to detect objects
* Use different architectures and weigh the tradeoffs.
* Apply an object detection pipeline to a video.

Open the notebook and work through it!

### Requirements

Install environment with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):

```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Change TensorFlow pip installation from `tensorflow-gpu` to `tensorflow` if you don't have a GPU available.

The environment should be listed via `conda info --envs`:

```sh
# conda environments:
#
carnd-advdl-odlab        /usr/local/anaconda3/envs/carnd-advdl-odlab
root                  *  /usr/local/anaconda3
```
